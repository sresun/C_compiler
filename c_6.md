6.5 Self-referential Structures

Suppose we want to handle the more general problem of counting the occurrences of all the
words in some input. Since the list of words isn't known in advance, we can't conveniently
sort it and use a binary search. Yet we can't do a linear search for each word as it arrives, to
see if it's already been seen; the program would take too long. (More precisely, its running
time is likely to grow quadratically with the number of input words.) How can we organize
the data to copy efficiently with a list or arbitrary words?

Chapter 6 - Structures

One solution is to keep the set of words seen so far sorted at all times, by placing each word
into its proper position in the order as it arrives. This shouldn't be done by shifting words in a
linear array, though - that also takes too long. Instead we will use a data structure called a
binary tree.
The tree contains one ''node'' per distinct word; each node contains
● A pointer to the text of the word,
● A count of the number of occurrences,
● A pointer to the left child node,
● A pointer to the right child node.
No node may have more than two children; it might have only zero or one.
The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains only words that are
lexicographically less than the word at the node, and the right subtree contains only words
that are greater. This is the tree for the sentence now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their party'', as built by inserting each word as it is encountered:

To find out whether a new word is already in the tree, start at the root and compare the new
word to the word stored at that node. If they match, the question is answered affirmatively. If
the new record is less than the tree word, continue searching at the left child, otherwise at the
right child. If there is no child in the required direction, the new word is not in the tree, and in
fact the empty slot is the proper place to add the new word. This process is recursive, since
the search from any node uses a search from one of its children. Accordingly, recursive
routines for insertion and printing will be most natural.

Chapter 6 - Structures

Going back to the description of a node, it is most conveniently represented as a structure with
four components:
struct tnode { /* the tree node: */
char *word; /* points to the text */
int count; /* number of occurrences */
struct tnode *left; /* left child */
struct tnode *right; /* right child */
};
This recursive declaration of a node might look chancy, but it's correct. It is illegal for a
structure to contain an instance of itself, but
struct tnode *left;
declares left to be a pointer to a tnode, not a tnode itself.
Occasionally, one needs a variation of self-referential structures: two structures that refer to
each other. The way to handle this is:
struct t {
...
struct s *p; /* p points to an s */
};
struct s {
...
struct t *q; /* q points to a t */
};
The code for the whole program is surprisingly small, given a handful of supporting routines
like getword that we have already written. The main routine reads words with getword
and installs them in the tree with addtree.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAXWORD 100
struct tnode *addtree(struct tnode *, char *);
void treeprint(struct tnode *);
int getword(char *, int);

Chapter 6 - Structures

/* word frequency count */
main()
{
struct tnode *root;
char word[MAXWORD];
root = NULL;
while (getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
if (isalpha(word[0]))
root = addtree(root, word);
treeprint(root);
return 0;
}
The function addtree is recursive. A word is presented by main to the top level (the root)
of the tree. At each stage, that word is compared to the word already stored at the node, and is
percolated down to either the left or right subtree by a recursive call to adtree. Eventually,
the word either matches something already in the tree (in which case the count is
incremented), or a null pointer is encountered, indicating that a node must be created and
added to the tree. If a new node is created, addtree returns a pointer to it, which is installed
in the parent node.
struct tnode *talloc(void);
char *strdup(char *);
/* addtree: add a node with w, at or below p */
struct treenode *addtree(struct tnode *p, char *w)
{
int cond;
if (p == NULL) { /* a new word has arrived */
p = talloc(); /* make a new node */
p->word = strdup(w);
p->count = 1;
p->left = p->right = NULL;
} else if ((cond = strcmp(w, p->word)) == 0)
p->count++; /* repeated word */
else if (cond < 0) /* less than into left subtree */
p->left = addtree(p->left, w);
else /* greater than into right subtree */
p->right = addtree(p->right, w);
return p;

Chapter 6 - Structures

}
Storage for the new node is fetched by a routine talloc, which returns a pointer to a free
space suitable for holding a tree node, and the new word is copied into a hidden space by
strdup. (We will discuss these routines in a moment.) The count is initialized, and the two
children are made null. This part of the code is executed only at the leaves of the tree, when a
new node is being added. We have (unwisely) omitted error checking on the values returned
by strdup and talloc.
treeprint prints the tree in sorted order; at each node, it prints the left subtree (all the
words less than this word), then the word itself, then the right subtree (all the words greater).
If you feel shaky about how recursion works, simulate treeprint as it operates on the tree
shown above.
/* treeprint: in-order print of tree p */
void treeprint(struct tnode *p)
{
if (p != NULL) {
treeprint(p->left);
printf("%4d %s\n", p->count, p->word);
treeprint(p->right);
}
}
A practical note: if the tree becomes ''unbalanced'' because the words don't arrive in random
order, the running time of the program can grow too much. As a worst case, if the words are
already in order, this program does an expensive simulation of linear search. There are
generalizations of the binary tree that do not suffer from this worst-case behavior, but we will
not describe them here.
Before leaving this example, it is also worth a brief digression on a problem related to storage
allocators. Clearly it's desirable that there be only one storage allocator in a program, even
though it allocates different kinds of objects. But if one allocator is to process requests for,
say, pointers to chars and pointers to struct tnodes, two questions arise. First, how
does it meet the requirement of most real machines that objects of certain types must satisfy
alignment restrictions (for example, integers often must be located at even addresses)?
Second, what declarations can cope with the fact that an allocator must necessarily return
different kinds of pointers?
Alignment requirements can generally be satisfied easily, at the cost of some wasted space, by
ensuring that the allocator always returns a pointer that meets all alignment restrictions. The

Chapter 6 - Structures

alloc of Chapter 5 does not guarantee any particular alignment, so we will use the standard
library function malloc, which does. In Chapter 8 we will show one way to implement
malloc.
The question of the type declaration for a function like malloc is a vexing one for any
language that takes its type-checking seriously. In C, the proper method is to declare that
malloc returns a pointer to void, then explicitly coerce the pointer into the desired type
with a cast. malloc and related routines are declared in the standard header <stdlib.h>.
Thus talloc can be written as
#include <stdlib.h>
/* talloc: make a tnode */
struct tnode *talloc(void)
{
return (struct tnode *) malloc(sizeof(struct tnode));
}
strdup merely copies the string given by its argument into a safe place, obtained by a call
on malloc:
char *strdup(char *s) /* make a duplicate of s */
{
char *p;
p = (char *) malloc(strlen(s)+1); /* +1 for '\0' */
if (p != NULL)
strcpy(p, s);
return p;
}

malloc returns NULL if no space is available; strdup passes that value on, leaving error-
handling to its caller.

Storage obtained by calling malloc may be freed for re-use by calling free; see Chapters 8
and 7.

Exercise 6-2. Write a program that reads a C program and prints in alphabetical order each
group of variable names that are identical in the first 6 characters, but different somewhere
thereafter. Don't count words within strings and comments. Make 6 a parameter that can be
set from the command line.

Exercise 6-3. Write a cross-referencer that prints a list of all words in a document, and for
each word, a list of the line numbers on which it occurs. Remove noise words like ``the,''
``and,'' and so on.
Exercise 6-4. Write a program that prints the distinct words in its input sorted into decreasing
order of frequency of occurrence. Precede each word by its count.
6.6 Table Lookup
In this section we will write the innards of a table-lookup package, to illustrate more aspects
of structures. This code is typical of what might be found in the symbol table management
routines of a macro processor or a compiler. For example, consider the #define statement.
When a line like
#define IN 1
is encountered, the name IN and the replacement text 1 are stored in a table. Later, when the
name IN appears in a statement like
state = IN;
it must be replaced by 1.
There are two routines that manipulate the names and replacement texts. install(s,t)
records the name s and the replacement text t in a table; s and t are just character strings.
lookup(s) searches for s in the table, and returns a pointer to the place where it was found,
or NULL if it wasn't there.
The algorithm is a hash-search - the incoming name is converted into a small non-negative
integer, which is then used to index into an array of pointers. An array element points to the
beginning of a linked list of blocks describing names that have that hash value. It is NULL if
no names have hashed to that value.

file:///H:/edonkey/docs/c/(ebook)%20The%20C%20...he_C_Programming_Language_by_K&R/chapter6.html (21 of 30) [23/11/02 10:15:35]

Chapter 6 - Structures

A block in the list is a structure containing pointers to the name, the replacement text, and the
next block in the list. A null next-pointer marks the end of the list.
struct nlist { /* table entry: */
struct nlist *next; /* next entry in chain */
char *name; /* defined name */
char *defn; /* replacement text */
};
The pointer array is just
#define HASHSIZE 101
static struct nlist *hashtab[HASHSIZE]; /* pointer table */
The hashing function, which is used by both lookup and install, adds each character
value in the string to a scrambled combination of the previous ones and returns the remainder
modulo the array size. This is not the best possible hash function, but it is short and effective.
/* hash: form hash value for string s */
unsigned hash(char *s)
{
unsigned hashval;
for (hashval = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)
hashval = *s + 31 * hashval;
return hashval % HASHSIZE;
}

Chapter 6 - Structures

Unsigned arithmetic ensures that the hash value is non-negative.
The hashing process produces a starting index in the array hashtab; if the string is to be
found anywhere, it will be in the list of blocks beginning there. The search is performed by
lookup. If lookup finds the entry already present, it returns a pointer to it; if not, it returns
NULL.
/* lookup: look for s in hashtab */
struct nlist *lookup(char *s)
{
struct nlist *np;
for (np = hashtab[hash(s)]; np != NULL; np = np->next)
if (strcmp(s, np->name) == 0)
return np; /* found */
return NULL; /* not found */
}
The for loop in lookup is the standard idiom for walking along a linked list:
for (ptr = head; ptr != NULL; ptr = ptr->next)
...
install uses lookup to determine whether the name being installed is already present; if
so, the new definition will supersede the old one. Otherwise, a new entry is created.
install returns NULL if for any reason there is no room for a new entry.
struct nlist *lookup(char *);
char *strdup(char *);
/* install: put (name, defn) in hashtab */
struct nlist *install(char *name, char *defn)
{
struct nlist *np;
unsigned hashval;
if ((np = lookup(name)) == NULL) { /* not found */
np = (struct nlist *) malloc(sizeof(*np));
if (np == NULL || (np->name = strdup(name)) == NULL)
return NULL;
hashval = hash(name);
np->next = hashtab[hashval];

Chapter 6 - Structures

hashtab[hashval] = np;
} else /* already there */
free((void *) np->defn); /*free previous defn */
if ((np->defn = strdup(defn)) == NULL)
return NULL;
return np;
}
Exercise 6-5. Write a function undef that will remove a name and definition from the table
maintained by lookup and install.
Exercise 6-6. Implement a simple version of the #define processor (i.e., no arguments)
suitable for use with C programs, based on the routines of this section. You may also find
getch and ungetch helpful.
